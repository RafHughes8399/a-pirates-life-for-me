ok for next time:
    -> implement singleton controls  x 
    -> have player check if any controls are preseed or down, then create an event x 
    -> define a ship controls that maps a control to a function x 
    -> then define on_event to call that function x 


    -> merge steer left and steer right into one 
    -> merge sail up and sail down into on 
    -> change anchor to be the same mechanic as sail and steer
    -> then test yay


bugs to fix
-> ship is not rendered 
-> ship does not move
-> anchor moves the wrong way

-> ship turning is funky 


ok camera bug because the target is not changing as the camera moves
lets start simple 


thought process is that because the ship is the target it 
does not get rendered, so make the target slightly behind the ship instead

check the values of the frustrum

// issue with the frustrum, it is rendering everything
// double check the test game and double check the numbers

and check the ocean texture tooo, its not darawin


rendering seems under control bugs to fix:
-> clamping anchor and sail values
-> fixing ship turning 
-> double check wind works
-> ocean rendering


-> sail turning 
-> check wind and ship movement
-> ocean rendering
