-> fix model and texture paths


-> rename classes and establish namespaces
-> switch from shared to unique ptr
-> fix up constructors and define the magic numbers
-> integrate octree




-> switch world to use the octree
-> add an object constructor to take in id, adjust the variables
-> swtich from shared and weak to unique and * 
-> then frustrum culling and rendering
-> then event and collision interaction system


-> switch to raw pointers  x 
-> finish world setup x 
-> go lower case and change from object to entities, establish a namespace
-> get rid of warnings, clean up model and texture paths

-> frustrum culling 
-> octree moving entities 
-> event handling and interaction infrastructure 
-> then 


-> a frustrum is comprised of 6 planes
-> ok i have the frustrum, then i need to create it and pass it to render 
-> make sure the frustrum updates with the camera movement
-> pass the
