-> hitboxes
-> terrain collision using the event system 




3rd May
-> establish a bounding box for the camera, 
-> if the bounding box of an object intersects with the camera, draw it


-> todo adjust ship jitters 
-> todo ensure consist render of camera target
-> todo add simulation distance cutoff too
