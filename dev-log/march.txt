A PIRATE'S LIFE FOR ME MARCH LOGS 

5th of March

implementing collision algorithm that is not O(n^2) that is stinky and yucky algorithm. I found resources for a 
linear algorithm

sort and sweep algorithm lets break it down: 


dealing with the AABB axis-aligned bounding box of an object


the idea is to maintain a sorted linked list 

on each axis, a box corresponds to an interval [b, e] on the axis. For all objects, these intervals
can be placed into a sorted list. The list is traversed to track active intervals

for an internval [b,e] if there are any other intervals [bi, ei] such that bi < e then 
the AABB is added to the list and a collision is potentially detected

then an interaction needs to occur, for that there can be an interaction class

the world objects list is sorted by the AABB, raylib can get you the bounding box of each object

do it for the axis with the highest variance



find the axis of maximal variance
sort the list of objects by their bounding box position on that axis
then find intersections for each entity by check the bounds with the next closest

if the bounds do not match end early, otherwise if they do, check for an intersection (hitboxes)

but you can set this up tomorrow easily enough I think (maybe aside from hitboxes for now)




then perform an interaction

defined by an interaction manager or something 
i think i should rewatch the videos to understand the logic better

there is a list of all interactions that could possibly happen in the game, you define then 
i.e ship-water interaction, ship-cannonball interaction, etc 

the interaction implementation should manipulate the two entiteis

you call the interaction based on the entiteis that are intersecting (rewatch the videos for this logic )



6th and 7th of March

ok final time chatting bout dis

sort and sweep

SORT GAME OBJECTS BY THEIR AABBs ON THE AXIS OF MOST VARIANCE

FOR THIS YOU NEED A CUSTOM COMPARATOR, that can sort AABB on the axis of most variance


9th of March
-> define an ocean class 
-> use ocean class for the ocean
-> implement ship interact
-> test buoyancy and collison

-> implement wind and ship controls 
-> adjusting sail direction and length
-> turning the wheel
-> dropping and raising anchor
