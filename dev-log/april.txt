1st of April
-> chunks generation
-> chunk rendering and simulation
-> moving objects between chunks

-> chunk debug 


2nd of April
-> chunk gen
-> chunk render debug
5th of April
i feel like im back to square one i don't understand
bit disheartening but we truck on

step one, should be easy enough 

make wind ship a observer-listener pattern


-> add oceans to the chunks
-> add the player to a chunk


3rd April
-> get player chunk
-> chunk simulate and render based on player chunk


5th April
-> take another stab at chunks 
-> generate chunks maybe not 25 by 25 but 15 by 15
-> generate and fill with ocean
-> hopefully the shared pointers help
-> then add the player to the chunk

-> then moving objects between chunks
-> then islands



9th of April
-> event system 

make the event, and then send the event

the game has the listeners, and defines what happens when the event occurs
when you want something to happen you send the event



15th of AApril
-> ok that kind of works, make the islands much smaller
-> make the rest of the islands, design them first, make them smaller, much smaller, main on the x and y, the height is fine for now
-> position them around the map
-> figure out how to size them, maybe draw bounding boxes around them ?
-> texture them 

-> collisions



18 April
-> add obj id 
-> debug positions
-> sort out sizing and texturing 
->
